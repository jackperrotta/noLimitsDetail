            Preferred Home Improvement was prompt and responsive throughout our working together. They responded with care to our request for caution with a newly sprouted lawn. They were timely, neat, thoroughly professional. We’re more than satisfied and I have already recommended them to a neighbor.

            Preferred Home Improvement replaced 1/3 of our roof, which is hard to get a contractor to do; they really only give a good price for a complete roof replacement.  They came up with a great approach to replacing two skylights found that were leaking from a less-than-ideal original installation in 1990.  This company is very professional.

              Preferred Home Improvement was prompt with their assessment of a small leak around a flue stack. They scheduled the repair for about two weeks later and did some small extra work I asked of them, including removing two satellite dishes and re-shingling the area. They cleaned up well and left no trace of their activities except a fresh repair!

              Preferred Home Improvement is very professional. Mike was very knowledgeable and made me feel comfortable with making a tough decision about my roofing project. They did not have that pushing sales tactic like other companies did. The work was done great, and I am very pleased.<br>

          Preferred Home Improvement replaced the flat portion of our roof. They removed the old roofing material, examined the wood, replaced a skylight, and installed new roofing material. The service provided by Preferred Home Improvement was commendable. There were pictures taken of the probable leak areas and a written estimate was provided on the initial visit. The service was very professional.

Project: Install or Replace an Asphalt Shingle Roof
Comments: I would recommend Preferred Home Improvement without hesitation. They were really fair priced, and Mike and his crew were extremely helpful. Mike went out of his way to do the free estimate himself. They were professional and friendly from start to finish. The crew was always punctual and courteous. I would definitely choose Preferred Home Improvement for any more home repair I may need.

Removed 2 old roofs and replaced it with Corning Owens Shingles.  They also replaced wood and made any necessary repairs and adjustments.  They also did repairs on my lower porch roof which was sagging do to poor work done by the previous contractor.
It went great.  They arrived at 7:00 AM and promptly placed tarps around and moved any items which could be damaged.  They completed the job by 4:30 PM and cleaned up great.  I love the new roof and was very pleased with the job.  Mike was extremely helpful and extremely pleasant and knowledgeable.  It is a big decision to make and he was very reassuring and pleasant to deal with in every way.  I felt assured that I could trust him and that he would be reliable and stand by his work.

My experience with Preferred Home Improvement was a pleasant and rewarding one. Mike Damario was the person who gave me the the estimate, and followed the total job to the end. he showed up in the morning (on time), and at the end of the day to check on the progress and ask if I had any questions. His crew would call him if there was something unexpected. the lead man on the job would tell me ,explain what the issue was and explain how they were going to fix it.
overall my experience with Mike and the company was exceptional. other contractors would come in do the work and leave. Never talk about what was going. This was a refreshing experience. I felt that the company cares about their customers and want them to be completely satisfied at the completion of the job.
At completion Mike inspect the job,checked the whole area to make sure it was cleaned properly. The workmanship is outstanding. they took their time, cleaned up after each process of the job. The crew was friendly, professional, experienced, punctual polite and respectful. Overall, I cant say enough good things about Preferred Home Improvement and Mike Damario and his foreman Walter. I would recommend this company to family, friends, and total strangers. I told Mike feel free have people call me and I would tell !st hand my experience
I would give this company an A++++

Communication skills, both written and verbal, are excellent.In summary, I highly recommend Preferred!!!

My wife and I needed to have our roof replaced on our 1940s home due to its age and appearance. We met with several popular roofing companies prior to meeting Mike from Preferred. After getting to know contractors from five different companies; it was an easy choice. Mike was so easy to work with; he gave us a very detailed estimate on the job. There weren't any hidden fees within our contract and our estimate was very accurate. Mike and his team arrived promptly and completed the job within the time frame originally agreed upon. His team of roofers were efficient, conscientious, and thorough. They took care when demolishing our roof and they left our property meticulous. Once the job was completed, he did a final walk through, and gave us a follow up call making sure we were satisfied with our services.  I highly recommend Preferred.  You will be more than thrilled with the services and results of your home improvement projects.

Mike D'Amario and his team with Preferred Home Improvement replaced our home roof, garage roof, garage windows, vinyl siding, as well as, all coordinating construction needed pursuant to damages we received from the 2015 hail storm. Mike was exceptional to work with.  He was friendly, easy to talk to and was on-call to our needs and questions.  He explained all construction needs in detail to us and educated us on all possibilities that would be available to us given the damage that we incurred with the storm. He was compassionate to our feeling of devastation that occurred to our home and followed through with all details discussed. His team with Preferred Home Improvement was timely, hardworking and did quality work for us.  They were all friendly and went out of their way to make the experience an easy one.  They were very neat and tidy and cleaned up completely at the end of each day. They always worked a full day;  which is exceptional in this day and age with contractors. Mike and his team were not satisfied until we were completely satisfied with the work they did. Overall, Mike and his team were wonderful to deal with and provided trustworthy, quality work for a fair and reasonable price.  We even had them continue on and work on my parent's home which with also done with the same quality and high level of care. I would recommend Mike D'Amario and his team with Preferred Home Improvements to anyone looking for the full package in a contractor.  You will not be disappointed!!!

Preferred Home Improvements completed the installation of our roof and gutters in a timely fashion and took great effort to make sure everything was done properly. Mike went above and beyond to make sure everything was completed to our satisfaction. He is very knowledgeable of storm damage and worked well with my homeowners insurance company. Something I was dreading having to do, he took a big load off my shoulders by handling that for me. The company also followed up with us weeks after to make sure everything was ok and to let us know not to hesitate contacting them if we needed to. I would definitely recommend Preferred Home Improvements to my neighbors and friends. That follow through was very important to me. Thank you for making the process so easy for me.
