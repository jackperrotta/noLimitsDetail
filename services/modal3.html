    <p class="ts003---Paragraph">It is important to understand that the true value in windows is a combination of beauty, thermal efficiency, and performance. That is why we sell and install only triple-paned, thermal performance windows to your home, reducing maintenance and cleanup while saving energy and the environment. As often as you look through windows, you also look at them. Each and every detail matters.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="ts003---Heading-2" id="u67411-7">Choosing The Right Windows</h2>
    <p class="ts003---Paragraph">Select beauty to complement your home as well as efficiency. Select slim, trim lines to create a graceful impression that emphasizes the view, not the window. Make sure that frames and sashes have a carpentered look. Choose locks and hardware that perfectly match the rest of the window, ones that practically disappear.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="ts003---Heading-2" id="u67411-12">Energy Savings</h2>
    <p class="ts003---Paragraph">Thermal efficiency delivers value two ways&#8212;by providing real comfort year-round, and by helping save money on cooling and heating. We use only windows that are designed to deliver outstanding thermal performance. Honeycomb frames filled with insulating air spaces that significantly reduce condensation; Double weather-stripping that locks out wind and weather; Double- and triple-paned integral glazing systems; High performance Low &#8220;E&#8221; glazing systems to keep summer heat out and winter heat in better than any other system in its class, and to significantly reduce damaging UV rays.</p>

	<h2 class="ts003---Heading-2" id="u67411-17">Easy Maintenance</h2>
    <p class="ts003---Paragraph">Tilt-in sash windows save time and trouble. They make cleaning quick and easy. Solid vinyl construction never flakes, chips, or rots&#8212;never needs painting or puttying. One-piece fusion-welded sashes never warp, shrink, or swell. A good balance system makes sashes easy to open and keeps them in place and never need adjustment for years of normal use. Trouble-free, virtually maintenance-free, operation for decades; Tilt-in sashes that make cleaning quick and easy; Solid vinyl construction that never flakes, chips, or rots&#8212;never needs painting or puttying; One-piece fusion-welded sashes that never warp, shrink, or swell; Balance systems that make sashes easy to open and keeps them in place and that never need adjustment</p>

    <h2 class="ts003---Heading-2" id="u67411-22">The Right Glass</h2>
    <p class="ts003---Paragraph">Where you live has a lot to do with the type of glass you should purchase. Thermal performance options like Low-E glass and argon gas can be added, but selecting the right combination is as important as selecting the right window configurations for your home. When a room faces the sun for the majority of the day, we recommend one type of Low-E glass for maximum solar control. Other rooms with less exposure can use less expensive Low-E glass. If your home has &#8220;cold spots&#8221; or &#8220;hot spots&#8221; we recommend using windows with insulating argon gas for maximum energy efficiency. If you have year-round shade from trees and shrubbery, you may not need a glass option that further reduces light transmittance, so your selection should be a literal reflection of your home and rooms&#39; locations.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="ts003---Heading-2" id="u67411-27">The Right Options</h2>
