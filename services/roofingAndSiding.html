        <h2>Roofing Installation</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes, it can be hard to tell if it's time for a new roof - most homeowners don't actually want to install new roofs. However, a roof replacement can not only keep your family safe from the elements, but it can also improve the curb appeal and value of your home. It's a good investment to make whether you're intending on staying in your home for years to come, or if you're planning on selling in the near future.
            <br>
            <br> Here at Preferred Home Improvement, we have over 30 years of experience specializing in roof replacement services for local homeowners. We work with many materials to give your home the best chance at ultimate protection. If you're looking to install a beautiful and lasting roof, you've come to the right place. Call Preferred Home Improvement and we will promptly come out to your home or business to meet with you. We will diagnose the problem and suggest a solution only using only the best roofing materials.

          <h3>ASPHALT SHINGLE ROOFING CONTRACTOR</h3>
          <p>
            Asphalt shingles are the most popular choice for roofing because they provide a durable roof for less money than any other roofing material. Asphalt shingles also come in a variety of styles and colors, so they can match almost any home. Threetab shingles are the most commonly-installed asphalt shingle because of their classic design and affordable cost. If you like the genuine wood-shake look, architectural shingles are a great option.
            <br>
            <br>Preferred Home Improvement offers a wide range of roofing shingle options from leading manufacturers. From cost-effective three-tab shingles to high-performance specialty products, we can help you choose the right shingle for your home and budget.
            <br>

          <h3>METAL ROOFING CONTRACTOR</h3>
          <p>
            Metal roofs provide energy savings, beauty, and protection for your home that can last a lifetime. Residential metal roofs are available in a wide variety of design to complement any style home. Offered in a rainbow of colors, your metal roof can be a traditional vertical seam profile, or be manufactured to resemble wood shake, slate, shingles or clay tiles.
            <br>
            <br>And, by choosing a metal roof, you'll save money and do your part for the environment. Conventional roofing products, including asphalt shingles, contribute an estimated 20 billion pounds of waste to U.S. landfills annually, whereas metal roofs can often be installed over an existing roof, eliminating the cost and eco-impact of tear-off and disposal.
            <br>
            <br> Many residential metal roofs now utilize reflective pigment technology, which results in overall home energy efficiency, and lower utility bills. In addition, all metal roofs are made from 30-60% recycled material.
            <br>
            <br> While your neighbors may re-roof their home many times, a high-quality metal roof will likely be the last roof you'll ever need. Resistant to cracking, shrinking and eroding, metal roofing systems can also withstand extreme weather conditions including heavy snow loads, hail storms and wildfires.
            <br>
          </p>
          <h3>Myths Uncovered about Metal Roofing</h3>
          <h4>Lightning</h4>
          <p>
            A metal roof will not increase the likelihood of lightning striking your home. However, if your home were hit by lightning, your metal roof would disperse the energy safely throughout the structure. Since metal roofing isn't combustible or flammable, it's a low risk and desirable roofing option where severe weather is concerned, especially for lightning.
          </p>
          <h4>Noise</h4>
          <p>
            A common misconception is that a metal roof will be noisier than other types of roofing. When installed with solid sheathing, a metal roof on your home will actually silence noise from rain, hail and bad weather, many times much better than other roofing materials.
          </p>
          <h4>Rust</h4>
          <p>
            Today's metal roofing systems are built to last. Steel metal roofing has a "metallic coating" made of either zinc or a combination of zinc and aluminum. This metallic coating prevents rust from forming and is bonded to the steel at the factory. Paint is then applied over the metallic coating to provide the long-lasting color homeowners desire
          </p>
          <h4>Dents</h4>
          <p>
            In most cases, a metal roof can withstand decades of abuse from extreme weather like hail, high winds, and heavy snow. Today's systems also have a 150-mph wind rating (equal to an F2 tornado), meaning your metal roof is also safe from wind gusts that can accompany hail storms.
          </p>
          <h4>Durability</h4>
          <p>
            Many people think you can't (or shouldn't) walk on a metal roof, but the truth is that you can safely walk any metal roof without damaging it. Before you walk your roof, however, we recommend you talk to your installed or roof manufacturer first. They will have the details on how to walk the particular roof you have, based on the style you chose and your roof pitch.
